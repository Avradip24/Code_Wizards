# Project Title: ML 24/25-01 Investigate Image Reconstruction by using Classifiers

## Problem Statement:
This project aims to explore the role of classifiers in Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) systems,
focusing on their ability to associate input patterns with meaningful predictions and reconstruct
original inputs from Sparse Distributed Representations (SDRs). By investigating and comparing two
existing classifiers, HtmClassifier and KNN, the project seeks to evaluate their functionality,
performance, and differences. Inspired by the SpatialLearning experiment, a new experiment will be
implemented to regenerate input images from SDRs produced by the Spatial Pooler (SP), leveraging
the IClassifier interface for learning and prediction. The experiment will use the ImageEncoder to
process images, reconstruct inputs via classifiers, and compare them with the originals using
similarity measures. Results will be illustrated with diagrams, analysed quantitatively, and discussed,
providing insights into the reconstruction capabilities of classifiers in HTM systems and their
practical implications.
